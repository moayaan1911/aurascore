This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Security & Scalability Features

The following security and scalability improvements have been implemented:

- [x] **Wallet Address Validation** - Validates that walletAddress is a valid Ethereum address format (0x + 40 hex characters)
- [x] **Caching** - Uses Next.js built-in Data Cache with `revalidate: 3600` (1 hour cache) for all Moralis API calls
- [x] **Rate Limiting** - Implements rate limiting (2 requests per 60 seconds per IP) to prevent abuse and unexpected API costs

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
